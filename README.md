# iso-commander
Port of bash shell program mounter_elite to C++ 
https://github.com/siyia2/mounter_elite

High performance `ISO` manager written in pure C++. `ISOs` are mounted under `/mnt/iso_{name}` format and conversions are stored in their respective source directories. `ROOT` access is required for `mount` `umount` and `write` operations.

For best experience execute with: `sudo isocmd`.
