State of the art secure and blazing fast terminal `ISO` manager written in C++. All paths are mounted under `/mnt/iso_*` format and conversions are stored in their respective source directories. `ROOT` access is essential for `mount&umount` operations.

For best experience execute with: `sudo isocmd`.

Features:
* Cached ISO management for reduced disk thrashing.
* Sanitized shell commands, tab completion and history support.
* Native C++ and libmount calls.
* Ultra lightweight with no reliance on external libraries for terminal control.
* Multithreaded asynchronous tasks leveraging state-of-the-art concurrent practices.
* Capable of seamlessly handling anywhere from 1 to an astonishing 100,000 ISO files.
* Supports most ISO filesystem types: iso9660, UDF, HFSPlus, Rock Ridge, Joliet, and ISOFs.
* Reimplemented ccd2iso and mdf2iso internally for converting BIN/IMG/MDF to ISO.
* Clean codebase in case someone decides to contribute in the future.
