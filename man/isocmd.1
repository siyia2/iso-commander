.SH FEATURES
Iso Commander provides the following key functionalities:

.TP

- Mount: Efficiently mounts .iso files using direct libmount calls. Root access is required for successful mounts.

- Umount: Unmounts groups of .iso files using sanitized shell commands. Root access is required for sucessful unmounts.

- CCD2ISO: Converts .bin and .img files to .iso.

- MDF2ISO: Converts .mdf files to .iso.

- NRG2ISO: Converts .nrg files to .iso.

.TP
.B ImportISO
Creates and updates an ISO cache for fast and organized access:
- The cache file has a maximum size of 10MB and supports up to 100,000 ISO entries.

- Cache file locations:
  - User mode: \fI~/.cache/iso_commander_cache.txt\fR
  - Root mode: \fI/root/.cache/iso_commander_cache.txt\fR

.TP
.B Automatic ISO Cache Management
- Locally removed .iso files are also automatically removed from the cache.

- Successfully converted .iso files are automatically added to the cache.

- The status of files that are deleted, moved, or copied by the program is automatically updated in the cache.

.TP
.B Built-in Filtering
- Includes native built-in filtering for all generated lists.

.SH
Notes:
- Files smaller than 5MB are excluded from the above operations.

- Partial conversions to .iso are automatically deleted.

- The limitations of the original conversion tools ccd2iso, mdf2iso, nrg2iso remain.

- Converted and moved/deleted/copied .iso files in root mode are automatically assigned to the current logged-in user.

- Ranges and single numbers can be used simultaneously in for all selections e.g. 1-3 5 7-6.

.SH USAGE TIPS
Iso Commander leverages the readline library for enhanced line-editing capabilities:

.TP
.B Tab completion
- At a scan prompt, pressing the Tab key once attempts to autocomplete paths. Pressing it twice or more lists available local files.

.TP
.B Useful Keyboard Shortcuts
- \fBCtrl+l\fR: Clears the screen and redraws the current line, keeping it at the top of the screen. 
  This is particularly useful when long file lists from autocompletion clutter the display.
  
- \fBCtrl+u\fR: Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.
  This is useful for quickly deleting a prompt line.
