.SH NAME
Iso Commander or isocmd.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Iso Commander (isocmd) is a command-line utility designed for efficiently managing .iso files and converting various image formats to .iso using asynchronous I/O operations.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Display the version of the program.

.SH FEATURES
Iso Commander provides the following key functionalities:

.TP
.B ManageISO
- Mount: Mounts chunks of .iso files using direct libmount calls under /mnt/_iso{name}. Root access is required for successful mounts.

- Umount: Unmounts chunks of .iso files using direct umount2 calls. Root access is required for sucessful unmounts.

- Delete/Move/Copy: Deletes, moves, or copies chunks of .iso files using native C++ calls.

.TP
.B Convert2ISO
- CCD2ISO: Converts .bin and .img files to .iso.

- MDF2ISO: Converts .mdf files to .iso.

- NRG2ISO: Converts .nrg files to .iso.

The conversion tools were originally written in C. I ported them to C++ and integrated them into Iso Commander. 
.br
Although I wanted to enhance their functionality, my limited knowledge of proprietary CD/DVD formats and the lack of multisession .bin or .img samples halted further development.
As a result, any limitations from the original code remain unchanged.

Thus any credits or curses belong to the original authors:

Salvatore Santagati (mdf2iso).
Gr√©gory Kokanosky (nrg2iso).
Danny Kurniawan and Kerry Harris (ccd2iso).


.TP
.B ImportISO
Creates and updates an ISO cache for fast and organized access:
- The cache file has a maximum size of 10MB and supports up to 100,000 ISO entries.

- Cache file locations:
  - User mode: \fI~/.cache/iso_commander_cache.txt\fR
  - Root mode: \fI/root/.cache/iso_commander_cache.txt\fR

.TP
.B Automatic ISO Cache Management
- Locally removed .iso files are also automatically removed from the cache.

- Successfully converted .iso files are automatically added to the cache.

- The status of files that are deleted, moved, or copied by the program is automatically updated in the cache.

.TP
.B Built-in Filtering
- Includes native built-in filtering for all generated lists.

.SH
Notes:
- Files smaller than 5MB are excluded from all operations.

- Partial conversions to .iso are automatically deleted.

- Converted and moved/deleted/copied .iso files in root mode are automatically assigned to the current logged-in user.

- Ranges and single numbers can be used simultaneously for all list selections e.g. 1-3 5 7-6.

.SH USAGE TIPS
Iso Commander leverages the readline library for enhanced line-editing capabilities:

.TP
.B Tab completion
- Pressing Tab once at a scan prompt autocompletes paths, pressing it twice or more lists available local files.

.TP
.B Useful Keyboard Shortcuts
- \fBCtrl+l\fR: Clears the screen and redraws the current line, keeping it at the top of the screen. 
  This is particularly useful when long file lists from autocompletion clutter the display.
  
- \fBCtrl+u\fR: Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.
  This is useful for quickly deleting a prompt line.

.TP
.B File path&Filter token history
Iso Commander uses readline history for saving file paths at scan prompts and at filter prompts for saving tokens.
.br
History can be browsed with up and down arrows at associated user prompts.

- History file location for file paths:
  - User mode: \fI~/.cache/iso_commander_history_cache.txt\fR
  - Root mode: \fI/root/.cache/iso_commander_cache.txt\fR

- History file location for filter tokens:
  - User mode: \fI~/.cache/iso_commander_pattern_cache.txt\fR
  - Root mode: \fI/root/.cache/iso_commander_pattern_cache.txt\fR

- Max unique history entries:
  - File paths: 25
  - Filter tokens: 25

When the history limit is reached, the oldest entries are replaced by new ones.
